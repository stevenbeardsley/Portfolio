This file contains my 2022 A level AQA Computer Science courseowork of which gained me 67/75 marks and contributed to my grade of an A.
The coursework is essentially a teacher, student interface that allows teachers to track students progress via test grades and 
see these results in a clear and easy way, which can later be stored in an excel document The teachers are also able to email the students 
making use of python libraries. On the student side, students are able to see their standings amongst their classmates, with the ability to join
up to three classes. They can log and track acitivities in real time whilst also having a functioning flashcard system where students can create 
sets of flashcards and use a quiz function to test their progress. This project for me demontrates making use of python libraries and being the first project I 
accomplished making use of object orientated programing techniques.
